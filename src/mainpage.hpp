 * \section sec_intro Introduction
 *
 * Ulphi is a C++ class library for calculating low frequency magnetic
 * fields.  It features
 *
 * - a modern object oriented interface
 *
 * - advanced material models
 *
 * - strong support for modelling anisothropic materials and laminates
 *   like stacked iron packages.
 *
 * As all geometry entities are modeled on a regular grid as it is
 * required by the finite difference method, neumann is especially
 * well suited (but of course not limited) to analyse devices with a
 * regular structure like transformers.
 *
 * Beside this library documentation there is also a detailed <a
 * href="../manual.pdf">reference manual</a>.
