## What is it?

Ulphi is a package for calculating fields in engineering using the
Finite Integration Techniques (FIT).  Until now it supports the
computation of (quasi) magnetostatic fields in 2D.  It has strong
support for modeling anisotropic materials.  That is useful i. e. to
model laminated stacks of iron.
