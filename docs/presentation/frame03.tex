\begin{frame}{What is it?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compute 2D magnetic fields
  \item Static and quasistatic fields supported
  \item Based on finite integration technique (FIT)
  \item Targets at models with a rather simple geometry
  \item Couple polar and cartesian sections in one model
  \item Strong support for nonlinear and anisotropic materials
  \end{itemize}
